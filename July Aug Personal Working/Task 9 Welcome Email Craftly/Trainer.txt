I'm sure you'll find your way around Github Copilot soon, but I thought I'd help get you started. You might be asking yourself: How can I code smarter? Github Copilot to the rescue. How hard is it to learn? No learning needed. Just ask and we write code alongside you. Github Copilot is here to guide you.
