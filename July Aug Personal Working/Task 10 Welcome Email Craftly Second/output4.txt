I know it's been a while since the funeral and I'm sure that you have forgotten about us, but we're so sorry for your loss. 

We were all so fond of Mr. John Raghav, he was such a nice man and so good at his job at the accounting department. 
It was a tragedy for the whole company for us to lose such a great man like him. 

He will be truly missed by us all.
