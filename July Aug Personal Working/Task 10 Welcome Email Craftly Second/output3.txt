I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your husband. 

I was very much touched by your words when I met you on my visit to Mumbai. I was also very grateful to you for inviting me to your home and allowing me to meet your children and family. 

I will always remember you and your family with great affection, and I am so sorry that I could not be with you at this time. 

With all good wishes,
