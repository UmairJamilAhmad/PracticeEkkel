Dear Megha,
It is with profound grief that we have learnt about the demise of your husband, Mr. Raghav Sharma. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague, friend and a great human being. 
We hope this letter finds you in good spirits. As a token of our support during this difficult time, the management has decided to give your son Raghav Sharma an opportunity to work with us for a year. 
We are aware of the fact that you would be under a lot of pressure to raise your son alone, and so we take it upon ourselves to provide him with all the support he needs to grow up healthy and happy.
Blessings from all of us at Orbiiit!
