Sub: Welcome to Tech Week
To: Martha Arthurton
Mail: Hi Martha,

We kicked off on Friday with the highly anticipated Hackathon. 30 volunteers, 500 hackers and over 21,000 hacking hours logged over the weekend. We think that's pretty special. 

Now, we're turning our attention to the Creator Stage, and what you can't miss at Sony Centre. 

First things first... Get here early. Breakfast is in the Lounge between 8am-10am. Catch your favourite talks on a first-come, first-served basis. 

Remember, you need both your wristband and badge at all times to access the festival. Looking forward to seeing you!
