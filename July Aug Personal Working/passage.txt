Garbage is a great environment hazard. It comes from various sources—used paper, tiffin packing’s, plastic bags, ice-cream wrappers, bottle caps, fallen leaves from trees and many more. Garbage makes the premises ugly, unkempt and breeds diseases.
A lot of trash that is thrown away contain material that can be recycled and reused such as paper, metals and glass which can be sent to the nearest recycling centre or disposed of to the junk dealer. It also contains organic matter such as leaves which can enrich soil fertility. A compost pit can be made at a convenient location where the refuse can be placed with layers of soil and an occasional sprinkling of water. This would help decomposition to make valuable fertilizer. This would also prevent pollution that is usually caused by burning such organic waste.


Patriotism is an old concept, as old perhaps as the earliest of humans civilizations. But all through the history of mankind, it has been narrowly understood. Today people have begun to realise that patriotism is an essential part of human instinct.
Patriotism has its negative sides particularly when it exceeds its proper bounds. People who think their own country to be the best and are blind to its weaknesses are not patriots at all.
We are the members of a large human family and so cannot neglect our duties and responsibilities towards it. Our love for the country should be conditioned by respect for the whole community. Narrow prejudice can do nothing except to bring misfortune. In trying to overlook others’ interest in the modern world, we harm our own.
Patriotism should be tempered with reason so that it may not be an evil.
